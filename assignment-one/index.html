        <p>My name is Anny, I'm 23 years old, I'm the oldest of 5 siblings, I was previously in the AMCA program here at NSCC, and now I'm back for another two years to study <strong>Graphic Design</strong>. I live in Sackville and I currently work at the <em>Sackville Sports Stadium</em>. I used to think that personal training was something I'd like to persue as a career but I quickly learned it definetley was not. I have always loved art and design so I decided it was time to persue something I actually love! </p>
